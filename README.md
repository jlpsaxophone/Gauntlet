# Gauntlet
CIS 580 game project. Galaga-inspired minigame with the objective being to reach planet earth while shooting away asteroids. 
Amo and shields will drop as collectable items.

Move with the arrow keys, and fire lasers with the space bar. Your ammo will be displayed on the top of the screen. You start the game with
one shield (displayed through blue particles around your ship), which allows you to survive a hit by an asteroid. Ammo and additional shields
will drop periodically for you to collect. Avoid or shoot asteroids and keep travelling through the gauntlet until you reach earth!
